# Heist

### Overview
Heist is a 2D, top-down adventure game I am working on using the Unity game engine. This game was inspired by the popular
video game <i>The Escapists</i>. The objective of the game is to execute some sort of heist, whether it be stealing money 
from a bank or a masterpiece from a museum. So far, this build supports PC and Android platforms.

### Features
* I implemented a custom navigation system because Unity's built-in version was not compatible with a 2D, top-down game. I
used an A* algorithm to find the shortest path between points. The game's NPCs used this algorithm to simulate autonomous life
in the game. 
* The sprites, which are excluded from this repository, are all self made.
